currently working on ehs-9297 pr comments , dave has added a comment 
that requirea to create a new employee window for multijob and 
i would continue working on it today and try to close it by today. 

utilizes for single job
EmployeeRecord.js, possibly hiding some elements of it like the 
'Check for existing record' button,
================================================
I don't think we gain anything by implementing both forms in the same window.
If anything it just makes it more complicated. I would probably implement 
the multijob window on its own, and then create another window that utilizes 
EmployeeRecord.js, possibly hiding some elements of it like the 
'Check for existing record' button, which would look something like:

form.down('button').hide();
